This project is a practical exploration of the algorithms presented in the book [**Grokking Algorithms**](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms) by Aditya Y. Bhargava. Instead of isolated code examples, each algorithm is applied in the context of a real-world hotel booking website.

## üåê Project Description

The system simulates a hotel reservation platform, using algorithms such as:

- **Linear Search** ‚Äì for scanning hotel lists
- **Binary Search** ‚Äì for efficient lookups in sorted datasets
- **Selection Sort**, **Quicksort** ‚Äì to sort results
- **Recursion** ‚Äì in navigation and availability checks
- **Hash Tables** ‚Äì to store user and reservation data
- **Graphs** ‚Äì for finding the shortest route between cities
- **Greedy Algorithms** ‚Äì to optimize room allocation
- **Dynamic Programming** ‚Äì to offer best package deals
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** ‚Äì for cost-efficient travel planning

> Each algorithm is encapsulated in its own Python class or module and used in realistic features across the system.
